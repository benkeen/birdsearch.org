### birdsearch.org rewrite

- Notable searches
- Fix colour of second button on intro overlay
- get loading spinner to load continually
- after clicking "anywhere" should have a bouncy thing pointing to the search bar.
- Improve speed of filter on species panel
- improve loading speed of species panel
- E.SET_MAP_TYPE
- browsers that don't support geolocation (or user says nope)
- Auto zoom field
- examine searches + confirm we're not duplicating requests
- zoom problem on duplicate searches
- revise build process to include version: bundle-2.0.0.js
- UX of settings modal
	- "Search" button - no save.
- bug. Searching for a location that returns no results on the immediate map, but can be zoomed out to see one. Needs to automatically zoom out to an appropriate zoom level.
- check that doing a second "Search nearby" doesn't re-request the user's location.
- translate Map, Satellite on google maps [localize entire map...?]

##### Bugs
- zoom level is incorrect after second search
- search for Manaus. Why isn't it centered?
- If no results, need to show a message saying as much.
- "51 bird species seen in the last 1 days" -> fix. Translate.

Locations Seen modal
    - position gets weird
    - style gets weird

#### At end
- translations


Small stuff 
- button styles
- translations


---------------------------

DONE
- polish About blurb
- finish marker modal
- error handling for header search
- Clicking "All Locations" doesn't work.
    - clicking link doesn't work
