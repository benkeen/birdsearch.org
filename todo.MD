### birdsearch.org rewrite

- Fix colour of second button on intro overlay
- get loading spinner to load continually
- after clicking "anywhere" should have a bouncy thing pointing to the search bar.
- Improve speed of filter on species panel
- improve loading speed of species panel
- E.SET_MAP_TYPE


##### Bugs
- zoom level is incorrect after second search
- search for Manaus. Why isn't it centered?
- If no results, need to show a message saying as much.
- "51 bird species seen in the last 1 days" -> fix. Translate.

Locations Seen modal
    - position gets weird
    - style gets weird

#### At end
- translations

---------------------------

DONE
- polish About blurb
- finish marker modal
- error handling for header search
- Clicking "All Locations" doesn't work.
    - clicking link doesn't work
