# eBird Advanced Search

This is an experiment to try different ways of viewing eBird data to provide a better understanding of 
bird sightings and distribution. See [ebirdsearch.org](https://ebirdsearch.org] for the current online version
of the script.

#### Current Version: 1.0.0

----

## v0.9 - proof of concept
This is a working copy which you can download from the tags section. Right now it's pretty basic. It uses a Google 
Map-based UI to show hotspots that have had bird reports made within a particular time period (1-30 days), and the 
option to view the bird species data made within any subset of those hotspots.

### Demo

## v1.0.0 
The initial version, now found at:
http://ebirdsearch.org

## v1.0.1
Currently under development. For this version I'm focusing on the following features:
- Converting the layout to responsive to allow for use on mobile devices.
- Adding in location recognition.
- Better error handling for no internet connection.
