# birdsearch.org

Like many birders I know, discovering [eBird.org](http://ebird.org) was a cause for celebration. It brought birding 
out of the dark ages of pen and pencil and into the digital age. Now we have a simple, centralized place for openly 
tracking observations.

But as a birder, I wanted a no-fuss high-level overview of a region; I wanted to see all observations being made in 
an area <i>right now</i>. I wanted to be able to see at a glance a full list of species being sighted - not have to 
hunt around to construct a list manually. The search options available on eBird are great, but don't quite fit my 
needs. This site was written to plug the gap.

This is now the third incarnation of this site. The first was a quick hack to test out their API and get a feel 
for what I could do with the data. The second (1.1.0) was a re-write to add in some new functionality and to use 
requireJS and other technologies. The latest version (Oct, 2016) was a second rewrite and redesign, this time using 
React, Redux and Node.
