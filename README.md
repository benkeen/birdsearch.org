# eBird Advanced Search

This is an experiment to try different ways of viewing eBird data to provide a better understanding of 
bird sightings and distribution.

## v0.9 - proof of concept

This is a working copy which you can download from the tags section. Right now it's pretty basic. It uses a Google 
Map-based UI to show hotspots that have had bird reports made within a particular time period (1-30 days), and the 
option to view the bird species data made within any subset of those hotspots. 

## v1.0.0 

You can find 1.0.0 online here:
