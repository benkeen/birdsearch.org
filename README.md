# birdsearch.org

This is an experiment to try different ways of viewing eBird data to provide a better understanding of 
bird sightings and distribution.

Right now the website is found at ebirdsearch.org, but it will soon be moved to birdsearch.org, once 1.1.0 is complete.

## v0.9 - proof of concept

This was a working copy which you can download from the tags section.

## v1.0.0 - initial version
You can find 1.0.0 online here:
http://ebirdsearch.org

## v1.1.0
Currently under development (August 2013). This is a complete re-write of the script to better architect the code,
improve the site design and add some functionality. This version includes the following:

- Three search types: "bird sightings", "notable sightings", "popular birding locations"
- mobile support
- advanced search functionality
- option to share search results, via URL
- multi-language support
- more accurate results based on lat/lng instead of human addresses (interface still has a simple address search)
