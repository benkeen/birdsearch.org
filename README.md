# eBird Advanced Search

This is an experiment to try different ways of viewing eBird data to provide a better understanding of 
bird sightings and distribution.

Right now it's pretty basic. It uses a Google Map-based UI to show hotspots that have had bird reports
made within a particular time period (1-30 days), and the option to view the bird species data made within
any subset of those hotspots.
