			<h2>About birdsearch.org</h2>
			<p>
				I wrote birdsearch.org to fill what I regard as a rather conspicuous gap in the functionality of the amazing
				<a href="http://ebird.org" target="_blank">eBird.org</a> site.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you haven't discovered eBird yet, do so now. It's an terrific resource and tool for birders, ornithologists,
				educators - anyone interested in birds. Birders around the world submit millions of observations a year to eBird,
				providing a wealth of information for viewing and analysis. The more people use it, the better it becomes.
			</p>
			<p>
				The problem is, the search functionality currently available through eBird is fairly limited. As a birder, I want a simple
				high-level overview of a region: where are the popular hotspots? What locations yield the most birds? What rarities
				are being spotted in my region, and where? This site attempts to help plug that gap.
			</p>
			<p>
				All the source code for this site is free and open source and found on <a href="GITHUB_URL">github</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Have fun!
