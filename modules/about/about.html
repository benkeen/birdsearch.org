<h2>About eBirdsearch.org</h2>
<p>
	I created eBirdsearch.org to fill what I regard as a rather conspicuous gap in the functionality of the amazing
	<a href="http://ebird.org" target="_blank">eBird.org</a> site.
</p>
<p>
	If you haven't discovered eBird yet, do so now. It's an incredible resource and tool for birders, ornithologists, educators -
	anyone interested in birds. Birders around the world submit millions of observations a year to eBird, providing a wealth of
	information for viewing and analysis. The more people use it, the better it becomes.
</p>
<p>
	The problem is, the search functionality currently available through eBird is fairly limited. As a birder, I want a simple
	high-level overview of a region: where are the popular hotspots? What locations yield the most birds? Which are most
	common? This site attempts to help plug that gap.
</p>
<p>
	All the code for this site is open source and <a href="<?php echo $GITHUB_URL; ?>" target="_blank">free for
	anyone to download and play with</a>. I've endeavoured to keep the number of data requests to eBird's site to a minimum
	so it doesn't put too much of a stress on their servers, but if it does, they're entirely within their rights to ask me to
	take the site down. Hopefully it won't come to that. I very much hope that one day this sort of functionality will be
	available directly through eBird, but in the meantime I'll try to keep the site up and running.
</p>
<p>
	Have fun!
